# WebSocket Automatic Reconnection Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the automatic reconnection logic implemented in the WebSocket middleware to handle connection drops gracefully, with special support for servers running on processor hardware.

## Reconnection Behavior

### Close Code Handling

The WebSocket middleware uses a simple approach: **auto-reconnect for everything except custom application codes**.

| Close Code                        | Scenario                 | Behavior                                   |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **4100**                          | Client-initiated cleanup | No reconnection, clean shutdown            |
| **4000**                          | User code changed        | No reconnection, show error, clear state   |
| **4002**                          | Room combination changed | No reconnection, manual reconnect required |
| **4001** (with touchpanel key)    | Connection loss          | **Auto-reconnect after 5s**                |
| **4001** (no touchpanel, no proc) | Processor shutdown       | No reconnection, manual reconnect required |
| **4001** (no touchpanel, proc HW) | Connection loss          | **Auto-reconnect after 5s**                |
| **All other codes**               | Any disconnect/error     | **Auto-reconnect after 5s**                |

**This includes:**

- **1000** (Normal Closure) - Typical processor hardware disconnect
- Any network errors, unexpected disconnects, etc.

**Code 4001 Logic**:

1. **If touchpanel key exists** → Always auto-reconnect (regardless of processor hardware flag)
2. **If no touchpanel key AND not on processor hardware** → Manual reconnect required
3. **If no touchpanel key BUT on processor hardware** → Auto-reconnect

### Processor Hardware Mode

The middleware checks the `serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware` flag from Redux state to determine reconnection behavior:

#### Default Behavior: Auto-Reconnect

**For most disconnects** (code 1000, network errors, unexpected closes, etc.):

1. Show user-friendly message: "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
2. Clear room/device state but preserve configuration
3. Wait 5 seconds, then attempt reconnection
4. **Repeat continuously every 5 seconds until successful**
5. Once connected, stop the reconnection loop

**Continuous Reconnection Loop**:

The middleware maintains a reconnection timer that:

- Starts when a reconnectable disconnect occurs
- Attempts to reconnect every 5 seconds
- Continues indefinitely until connection succeeds
- Is automatically stopped when connection is established
- Is also stopped for terminal errors (codes 4000, 4002, 4100, or 4001 on non-processor hardware)

**Code**:

```typescript
const startReconnectionLoop = (dispatch: Dispatch) => {
  if (state.reconnectTimer) {
    clearTimeout(state.reconnectTimer);
    state.reconnectTimer = null;
  }

  console.log('WebSocket middleware: Starting reconnection loop...');

  state.reconnectTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    state.waitingToReconnect = false;
    state.reconnectTimer = null;
    console.log('WebSocket middleware: Attempting automatic reconnection...');
    dispatch(wsConnect());
  }, 5000);
};

// On disconnect:
console.log('WebSocket middleware: Clearing state on disconnect');
dispatch(
  uiActions.setErrorMessage('Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect...')
);
dispatch(runtimeConfigActions.setWebsocketIsConnected(false));
dispatch(devicesActions.clearDevices());
dispatch(roomsActions.clearRooms());
dispatch(uiActions.clearAllModals());
dispatch(uiActions.clearSyncState());

// Start continuous reconnection attempts
startReconnectionLoop(dispatch);

// On successful connection:
newWs.onopen = (ev: Event) => {
  console.log('WebSocket middleware: Connected');
  state.waitingToReconnect = false;
  stopReconnectionLoop(); // Stop trying to reconnect
  dispatch(runtimeConfigActions.setWebsocketIsConnected(true));
};
```

#### Special Case: Code 4001 Based on Touchpanel Key

**Scenario**: Code 4001 behavior depends on touchpanel key presence and processor hardware flag

**Priority Logic**:

1. **Touchpanel key exists** → Always auto-reconnect (best indicator of active touchpanel)
2. **No touchpanel key + not on processor hardware** → Manual reconnect required
3. **No touchpanel key + on processor hardware** → Auto-reconnect

**Code**:

```typescript
// Handle code 4001 based on touchpanel key presence
if (closeEvent.code === 4001) {
  const currentState = getState() as LocalRootState;
  const hasTouchpanelKey = !!currentState.runtimeConfig?.touchpanelKey;

  if (hasTouchpanelKey) {
    console.log(
      'WebSocket middleware: Code 4001 received with touchpanel key present, will auto-reconnect'
    );
    // Will fall through to auto-reconnect logic below
  } else if (!serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware) {
    console.log(
      'WebSocket middleware: Processor disconnected (no touchpanel key, not on processor hardware)'
    );
    stopReconnectionLoop();
    dispatch(
      uiActions.setErrorMessage('Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect')
    );
    clearStateDataOnDisconnect(dispatch);
    return;
  } else {
    console.log(
      'WebSocket middleware: Code 4001 on processor hardware (no touchpanel key), will auto-reconnect'
    );
    // Will fall through to auto-reconnect logic below
  }
}
```

**Touchpanel Key Priority**: The presence of a touchpanel key indicates an active touchpanel connection that should be maintained, so it takes priority over the processor hardware flag for reconnection decisions.

#### When Server is NOT on Processor Hardware (`serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware: false`)

**Scenario**: Server is on a computer/VM that might be shut down

- Disconnect code 4001 likely means server is stopping
- Auto-reconnection would be futile
- User should manually reconnect when server restarts

**Behavior on disconnect (code 1000 or 4001)**:

1. Show error message: "Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect"
2. Clear all state (full cleanup)
3. Wait for manual user action
4. **No automatic reconnection**

**Code**:

```typescript
// Handle code 1000 (Normal Closure)
if (closeEvent.code === 1000) {
  if (!serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware) {
    console.log(
      'WebSocket middleware: Normal closure (not on processor hardware)'
    );
    dispatch(
      uiActions.setErrorMessage('Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect')
    );
    clearStateDataOnDisconnect(dispatch);
    return;
  }
}

// Also handle 4001
if (closeEvent.code === 4001 && !serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware) {
  console.log(
    'WebSocket middleware: Processor disconnected (not on processor hardware)'
  );
  dispatch(
    uiActions.setErrorMessage('Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect')
  );
  clearStateDataOnDisconnect(dispatch);
  return; // Early exit - no auto-reconnect
}
```

### Unexpected Disconnects

For any other close codes (network issues, server restarts, etc.):

- **Automatic reconnection after 5 seconds**
- Applies regardless of `serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware` value
- Handles edge cases like network blips, router restarts, etc.

**Code**:

```typescript
else if (closeEvent.code !== 4001 && closeEvent.code !== 4002) {
  console.log(
    'WebSocket middleware: Attempting automatic reconnection after unexpected disconnect...'
  );
  dispatch(wsReconnect());
}
```

```

## Connection Lock Mechanism

The middleware uses a `waitingToReconnect` flag to prevent concurrent reconnection attempts:

```typescript
if (state.client || state.waitingToReconnect) {
  console.log('Already connected or waiting to reconnect');
  return;
}

state.waitingToReconnect = true;

try {
  // Connection logic...
  await connect(store.dispatch, store.getState);
  state.waitingToReconnect = false;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Connection failed:', error);
  state.waitingToReconnect = false;
}

// On disconnect - clear client reference immediately
newWs.onclose = (closeEvent: CloseEvent): void => {
  console.log('WebSocket middleware: Disconnected');

  // Critical: Clear the client reference so reconnection can proceed
  state.client = null;

  // ... handle reconnection logic
};
```

## Anti-Flashing Mechanism

To prevent the UI from flashing between connected/disconnected states during reconnection attempts, the middleware uses a delayed connection state update:

```typescript
newWs.onopen = (ev: Event) => {
  console.log('WebSocket middleware: Connected');
  state.waitingToReconnect = false;
  stopReconnectionLoop();

  // Delay setting connected state to avoid flashing during failed reconnection attempts
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Only set connected if this WebSocket is still the current client
    if (state.client === newWs && newWs.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      dispatch(runtimeConfigActions.setWebsocketIsConnected(true));
    }
  }, 100);
};
```

**Why this prevents flashing**:

- WebSocket `onopen` can fire briefly even for connections that will immediately fail
- Without delay: `onopen` → `isConnected = true` → UI shows children → `onclose` → `isConnected = false` → UI shows DisconnectedMessage (flashing)
- With delay: `onopen` → wait 100ms → check if still connected → only then set `isConnected = true`

This ensures:

- Only one connection attempt at a time
- **Client reference is cleared immediately on disconnect**
- Prevents "already connected" errors on reconnection
- **No UI flashing during reconnection attempts**
- No race conditions
- Clean state management

## User Experience

### For All Users

✅ **Continuous automatic reconnection**

- Connection drops are handled automatically
- **Attempts reconnection every 5 seconds continuously**
- No limit on retry attempts - keeps trying until successful
- User sees "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
- App reconnects without user intervention
- Room status automatically requested on reconnect
- Minimal disruption to workflow

### Special Behavior for Non-Processor Hardware (Code 4001)

✅ **Clear indication when server is intentionally stopped**

- User sees "Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect"
- No continuous retry attempts (prevents log spam)
- User knows to check server status
- Manual reconnect when ready

## Configuration

The `serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware` flag is set during initialization from the `/appversion` endpoint:

```typescript
const { data: versionInfo } = await httpClient.get<VersionInfo>(
  `${config.apiPath}/appversion`
);
dispatch(
  runtimeConfigActions.setServerIsRunningOnProcessorHardware(
    versionInfo.serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware
  )
);
```

This is stored in Redux state at `runtimeConfig.serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware`.

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Normal Processor Disconnect (Code 1000)

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Stop processor connection (should send close code 1000)
3. **Expected**: Shows "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
4. **Expected**: Auto-reconnects after 5s
5. **Expected**: Room status automatically requested on reconnect

### Test 2: Network Drop

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Simulate network drop (disconnect WiFi for 3 seconds)
3. **Expected**: Auto-reconnects after 5s
4. **Expected**: Shows "Connection lost..."
5. **Expected**: Multiple retry attempts until network is back

### Test 3: Code 4001 with Touchpanel Key Present

1. Set touchpanel key in runtime config: `runtimeConfig.touchpanelKey = "some-key"`
2. Connect to WebSocket
3. Trigger disconnect with close code 4001
4. **Expected**: Auto-reconnects after 5s (regardless of processor hardware flag)
5. **Expected**: Shows "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
6. **Expected**: Continuous retry attempts until successful

### Test 4: Code 4001 without Touchpanel Key (Processor Hardware)

1. Set `serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware: true`
2. Ensure no touchpanel key: `runtimeConfig.touchpanelKey = null`
3. Connect to WebSocket
4. Trigger disconnect with close code 4001
5. **Expected**: Auto-reconnects after 5s
6. **Expected**: Shows "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."

### Test 5: Code 4001 without Touchpanel Key (Non-Processor Hardware)

1. Set `serverIsRunningOnProcessorHardware: false`
2. Ensure no touchpanel key: `runtimeConfig.touchpanelKey = null`
3. Connect to WebSocket
4. Stop server with close code 4001
5. **Expected**: Shows "Processor has disconnected. Click Reconnect"
6. **Expected**: No auto-reconnect attempts
7. **Expected**: Manual reconnect button works when server is back

### Test 5: User Code Changed (Code 4000)

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Trigger user code change (code 4000)
3. **Expected**: Shows "User code changed. Click reconnect to enter the new code"
4. **Expected**: No auto-reconnect attempts
5. **Expected**: State is cleared

### Test 6: Room Combination Changed (Code 4002)

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Trigger room combination change (code 4002)
3. **Expected**: Shows "Room combination changed. Click Reconnect to re-join the room"
4. **Expected**: No auto-reconnect attempts
5. **Expected**: State is cleared

### Test 7: Continuous Reconnection Attempts

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Stop server completely
3. **Expected**: Shows "Connection lost. Attempting to reconnect..."
4. **Expected**: Attempts reconnection every 5 seconds continuously
5. Restart server after 30 seconds
6. **Expected**: Successfully reconnects on next attempt
7. **Expected**: Reconnection loop stops after successful connection

### Test 8: Multiple Rapid Disconnects

1. Connect to WebSocket
2. Disconnect and reconnect rapidly
3. **Expected**: Connection lock prevents multiple simultaneous attempts
4. **Expected**: Reconnection timer is reset properly on each disconnect
5. **Expected**: No race conditions or duplicate connections

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Continuous reconnection** - Never gives up until connection succeeds
2. ✅ **Better UX for all deployments** - Seamless recovery from any network issue
3. ✅ **Clear feedback for terminal errors** - User knows when manual action is needed
4. ✅ **Handles long outages gracefully** - Keeps trying every 5 seconds indefinitely
5. ✅ **Prevents connection spam** - Lock mechanism prevents race conditions
6. ✅ **Automatic room status refresh** - State syncs on reconnection
7. ✅ **Production-ready error handling** - Different strategies for different scenarios
8. ✅ **Smart timer management** - Stops reconnection loop on success or terminal errors

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements for future iterations:

1. **Exponential backoff** - Increase delay between retries (5s, 10s, 20s...) to reduce load during extended outages
2. **Max retry limit with notification** - After N attempts, ask user if they want to continue trying
3. **Network status detection** - Use Navigator.onLine API to detect network availability
4. **Ping/Pong heartbeat** - Detect dead connections proactively
5. **Connection quality indicators** - Show signal strength or latency to user
6. **Offline queue** - Buffer messages to send when reconnected
